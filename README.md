# Assignment 3 - Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python

## üìå Description

This repository contains two Python programs as part of Assignment 3:

### Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
- Defines a function `factorial(n)` that computes the factorial using a loop.
- The function handles basic edge cases like 0 and negative inputs.
- Outputs the factorial of a sample number (5).

### Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
- Takes a number as input from the user.
- Calculates and displays:
  - Square root
  - Natural logarithm (log base e)
  - Sine of the number (in radians)
- Includes input validation and error handling.
